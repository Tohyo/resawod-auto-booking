# Resawod autoreservation

## Purpose

This project aimed to prevent me to always have to go on the resawod website or application to book my next crossfit session

## How does this work

The project contains only one command: `bin/console app:resa-wod`

This command will book the next session according to the booking configuration array in the command (yes, this should be in the config instead of the code but since it's just for me :shrug).
